Here are some files of several types.

1. abstract database interface file - "DatabaseInterface.php"
	It is an interface (like abstract class) that include the general methods (open, close, get/read, set/write, delete, and more) of database engine. They are all the empty functions.
	The classes derive from this interface must implement their abstract methods.

2. ../GlobalValues.php
	What you see is...
	/**
     * @var array $db_types database type array - global as constant
     */
    $db_types = array(
    	'bdb' => 'BerkeleyDB',
    	'mysql' => 'MysqlDB',
    	'xml' => 'XmlDB',
    	'json' => 'JsonDB',
    	'txt' => 'TextDB',
    );
    If new database engine needs to be added, must add its info here 1st.

3. XyzDB.php
	Database engine "xyz" wrapper class derived from DatabaseInterface.
	e.g. MysqlDB.php
	TO add new database engine, it is needed to place a corresponding file "XyzDB.php" here.
	* mysql_noid.conf.php: contains MysqlDB class's configuration information in PHP style.

4. README document.
	It's me. :)

Thank you for reading.
