            what:      unlimited sequential identifiers of form .zd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind 
       and mint an unbounded number of identifiers
       with the template ".zd".
       Sample identifiers would be "61220/utsc5" and "61220/utsc99353".
       Minting order is sequential.
            when:      20210313112037
            where:     ark-services:/var/www/vagrant/html/admin/db
            Version:   Noid 1.1.1-0.424-php
            Size:      unlimited
            Template:  .zd
                   A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_utsc1+".  Note:
                   separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
                   short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
                   "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
            Policy:    (:G--NI--)
                   This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
                     "G--NI--", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
